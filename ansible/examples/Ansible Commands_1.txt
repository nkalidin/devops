Why use ad-hoc commands?
Ad-hoc commands are great for tasks you repeat rarely. For example, if you want to power off all the machines in your lab for Christmas vacation, you could execute a quick one-liner in Ansible without writing a playbook. An ad-hoc command looks like this:

$ ansible [pattern] -m [module] -a "[module options]"
---------------------------------------------------------

Rebooting servers

$ ansible atlanta -a "/sbin/reboot"
By default Ansible uses only 5 simultaneous processes. If you have more hosts than the value set for the fork count, 
Ansible will talk to them, but it will take a little longer. To reboot the [atlanta] servers with 10 parallel forks:

$ ansible atlanta -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10
$ ansible atlanta -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10 -u username
$ ansible atlanta -a "/sbin/reboot" -f 10 -u username --become [--ask-become-pass]

##Shell Module

$ ansible raleigh -m shell -a 'echo $TERM'
When running any command with the Ansible ad hoc CLI (as opposed to Playbooks), 
pay particular attention to shell quoting rules, so the local shell retains the variable and passes it to Ansible. 
For example, using double rather than single quotes in the above example would evaluate the variable on the box you were on.


Managing files : File Module

An ad-hoc task can harness the power of Ansible and SCP to transfer many files to multiple machines in parallel. 
To transfer a file directly to all servers in the [atlanta] group:

$ ansible atlanta -m copy -a "src=/etc/hosts dest=/tmp/hosts"
$ ansible webservers -m file -a "dest=/srv/foo/a.txt mode=600"
$ ansible webservers -m file -a "dest=/srv/foo/b.txt mode=600 owner=mdehaan group=mdehaan"

The file module can also create directories, similar to mkdir -p:

$ ansible webservers -m file -a "dest=/path/to/c mode=755 owner=mdehaan group=mdehaan state=directory"

As well as delete directories (recursively) and delete files:

$ ansible webservers -m file -a "dest=/path/to/c state=absent"


Managing packages

You might also use an ad-hoc task to install, update, or remove packages on managed nodes using a package management module 
like yum. To ensure a package is installed without updating it:

$ ansible webservers -m yum -a "name=screen state=present"
To ensure a specific version of a package is installed:

$ ansible webservers -m yum -a "name=acme-1.5 state=present"

To ensure a package is at the latest version:

$ ansible webservers -m yum -a "name=acme state=latest"

To ensure a package is not installed:

$ ansible webservers -m yum -a "name=acme state=absent"

Ansible has modules for managing packages under many platforms. If there is no module for your package manager, you can install packages using the command module or create a module for your package manager.

Managing users and groups

You can create, manage, and remove user accounts on your managed nodes with ad-hoc tasks:

$ ansible all -m user -a "name=foo password=<crypted password here>"

$ ansible all -m user -a "name=foo state=absent"

Managing services

Ensure a service is started on all webservers:

$ ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=started"
Alternatively, restart a service on all webservers:

$ ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=restarted"
Ensure a service is stopped:

$ ansible webservers -m service -a "name=httpd state=stopped"
Gathering facts
Facts represent discovered variables about a system. 
You can use facts to implement conditional execution of tasks but also just to get ad-hoc information about your systems.

To see all facts:

$ ansible all -m setup
